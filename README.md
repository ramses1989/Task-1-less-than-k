This code serves as a unique tool for sifting through a list of numbers to identify those that fall below a specified threshold, but with a twistâ€”it leverages 
quantum computing concepts. Crafted in Python and harnessing the capabilities of the PennyLane library for quantum machine learning, it offers a novel approach 
to data processing. The core function, less_than_k, operates by orchestrating a quantum simulation akin to flipping switches in a quantum landscape. For each number 
in the list provided, it evaluates whether it is less than the given threshold k, effectively toggling a quantum switch if the condition holds true. Upon executing 
this quantum circuit and observing the results, the function then extracts and returns a refined list containing only those numbers that successfully passed the threshold 
test. This ingenious process combines classical programming with quantum-inspired methods, offering a glimpse into the potential of quantum computing paradigms for solving 
real-world problems. The provided example showcases the practical application of this function by identifying numbers less than 7 from a predefined list and presenting them 
in a comma-separated format.
